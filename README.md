# Spam-Detection--Project
Spam Detection using Machine Learning

This project is a real-world implementation of a Spam Message Classifier, which detects whether a given message is spam or not. It uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques like TF-IDF vectorization to process the text data and a Multinomial Naive Bayes model to classify the messages. The system is trained on a Kaggle dataset that contains over 5,000 SMS messages labeled as “spam” or “ham” (not spam). This kind of project is widely used in email systems, SMS filters, and messaging platforms to block unwanted or harmful messages.

The data used in this project comes from the SMS Spam Collection Dataset, which includes real-life examples of spam and non-spam text messages. After downloading the dataset, the messages are cleaned, preprocessed, and converted into numerical form using TF-IDF vectorizer, which helps the model understand which words are important in spam messages. This step is important for handling unstructured text data, and it forms the core of NLP-based machine learning applications.

The model chosen for this project is Multinomial Naive Bayes, which is fast, lightweight, and well-suited for text classification problems. It learns from the training data and makes predictions on new messages. After training, the model shows excellent performance, achieving an accuracy of around 97-98%, which means it can classify most messages correctly. The trained model and vectorizer are saved using Python’s joblib module so they can be reused for predictions without retraining.

To test the model, a simple script is included where users can enter a message, and the system will predict whether it’s spam or not. This script loads the saved model and vectorizer, processes the user’s message, and instantly gives a result. This makes the project interactive and practical for real-world testing. You can even convert it into a web app using Streamlit or integrate it into an email client or messaging app for live spam detection.

This project demonstrates a strong understanding of NLP, ML model building, text vectorization, and real-world problem-solving. It is ideal for showcasing your skills in job interviews or portfolio presentations. You can improve this project further by adding a user interface using Streamlit, trying deep learning models like LSTM or BERT, or even deploying it on the cloud. Overall, this project shows how spam detection works practically and how machine learning can be used in everyday digital communication platforms.
